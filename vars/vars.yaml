#Edit variables (commented EDIT) to work with your Nutanix Prism Central and AWS account
#My setup includes the aws key/secret in the default credential stanza of my home directory
#which is standard as my ansible controler runs on the same ubuntu 20.04.1 VM.
#I do not use ansible vault or best practices around passwords.
#ansible vault not used to protect passwords - feel free to implement it!
